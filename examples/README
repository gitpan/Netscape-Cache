grepcache.pl
------------
Command line tool for searching URLs with perl regular expresions. Returns
the cache file names of matching URLs.

Usage:
	grepcache.pl URL

nscache
-------
This is an example for a small frame based offline reader. If you have
CGI::Request from CGI-modules-2.74.tar.gz, you can sort URLs by name,
date, type and size and restrict display of URLs to images, text or html.

INSTALLATION

nscache is meant to be run as a cgi script. Therefore, you need a httpd
running on your system. To make the script a cgi script you have
following options:

* Copy nscache to a public cgi directory. Make sure the path pointing to
  nscache in cache.html is correct.

* Append a ".cgi" to nscache. This works for Apache.

* Use the suEXEC feature of Apache 1.2 (see
.../htdocs/manual/suexec.html of your Apache documentation).

Since ~/.netscape/cache is usually read-only, you have to run the script as a
setuid program, unless you use the suEXEC feature. So, you have to do a
"chmod u+s nscache.cgi". If you don't have to run the script as a setuid
program, you have to replace the #!/usr/local/bin/suidperl line in
nscache with #!/usr/local/bin/perl (or what else your path to perl is).

WARNING

Running nscache as a cgi script implies that everybody with access to
your httpd may run this script and use your cache information. If you
are on a stand-alone system, you won't bother, but otherwise you
should add .htaccess protection.
