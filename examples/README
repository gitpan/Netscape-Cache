grepcache.pl
------------
Command line tool for searching URLs with perl regular expresions. Returns
the cache file names of matching URLs. With the -r option, you can get
the correspoding URL for a cache file.

Usage:
	grepcache.pl [-ilv] [-r] URLs
-i: search case insensitive
-l: print the full pathname of found cachefiles
-v: show more information (content size, last modified time etc.)
-r: reverse search (search for cachefiles)

Examples:
	$ ./grepcache.pl freebsd
	http://www.de.freebsd.org/newsflash.html: 01/cache33BAF2210010702.html
	$ lynx ~/.netscape/cache/01/cache33BAF2210010702.html

	$ ./grepcache.pl -r 01/cache33BAF2210010702.html
	http://www.de.freebsd.org/newsflash.html: 01/cache33BAF2210010702.html

	$ ./grepcache.pl -l freebsd
	/home/e/eserte/.netscape/cache//01/cache33BAF2210010702.html

delcache.pl
-----------
Delete cache files and their db entries. Matching is done with perl regular
expressions.

Usage:
	delcache.pl [-f] [-q] [-i] URLs
-q: quiet
-i: case insensitive
-f: force deletion if netscape's lock file exists

Example:
	$ ./delcache.pl http://localhost/ http://127.0.0.1

Remove index entries without a matching cache file:

	delcache.pl -clean

nscache
-------
This is an example for a small frame based offline reader. If you have
CGI.pm (standard in perl5.004) or CGI::Request from
CGI-modules-2.74.tar.gz, you can sort URLs by name, date, type and
size and restrict display of URLs to images, text or html.

INSTALLATION

nscache is meant to be run as a cgi script. Therefore, you need a
httpd running on your system (If you don't have httpd, you may execute
"perl nscache > mycache.html" in a shell and load the generated file
directly from the Navigator). To make the script a cgi script you have
following options:

* Copy nscache to a public cgi directory. Make sure the path pointing to
  nscache in cache.html and cache-control.html is correct.

* Append a ".cgi" to nscache. This works for Apache.

* Use the suEXEC feature of Apache 1.2 (see
.../htdocs/manual/suexec.html of your Apache documentation).

Copy the files cache.html, cache-control.html and blank-page to a
directory which may be read by your httpd (e.g. ~/public_html, but
preferably to the same location as the nscache script).

Since ~/.netscape/cache is usually read-only, you have to run the
script as a setuid program, unless you use the suEXEC feature. So, you
have to do a "chmod u+s nscache.cgi". If you have to run the script as
a setuid program, you have to replace the line
		#!/usr/local/bin/perl
in nscache with
		#!/usr/local/bin/suidperl
(or what else your path to perl is).

WARNING

Running nscache as a cgi script implies that everybody with access to
your httpd may run this script and use your cache information. If you
are on a stand-alone system, you won't bother, but otherwise you
should add .htaccess (or similar) protection.

USAGE

cache.html generates a frameset with three frames. The left frame
contains the list of the cached documents. The bottom frame is meant
as a control bar (cache-control.html). You may change the sorting (by
name, by date ...) or restrict URLs to a given MIME type (html, image
...). To generate a new list click on the submit button. The largest
frame contains the actual document.

There are two types for accessing the cached documents: you can access
the cached files under their real URL. If you want to use this type
and browse offline via Netscape, you have to set Options->Network
Preferences->Verify Document to Never. The second type is direct access,
which accesses the cached files directly from the cache dir.
