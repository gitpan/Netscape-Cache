Netscape::Cache Module

Netscape::Cache provides access to the information stored in index.db of
Netscape's cache directory. Only Netscape versions 2.x, 3.x and 4.x are
supported (tell me if you want Netscape-1.x support).

This module is inspired by Netscape::History by Neil Bowers and
Richard Taylor.

You need at least perl5.002 and DB_File to run this module. I have success
reports for these platforms:
- Linux-2.0.5
- FreeBSD-2.2, 2.2.6 and 2.2.8
- Solaris 2.6
- MS-DOS/Windows3.1 using the $CPAN/ports/msdos/dosperl.zip port

You also need the old Berkeley DB (e.g. 1.85), not the new version
2.x.x. See the pod documentation for more information about this.

To install, type

	$ perl Makefile.PL
	$ make
	$ make install

You may also want to test the module with

	$ make test

Example programs are included in the POD and in the examples directory.
