Netscape::Cache Module

Netscape::Cache provides access to the information stored in index.db of
Netscape's cache directory.

This module is inspired by Netscape::History by Neil Bowers and
Richard Taylor.

You need DB_File to run this module. I got success reports for
this platforms:
- Linux-2.0.5
- FreeBSD-2.2.

To install, type

	$ perl Makefile.PL
	$ make
	$ make install

You may also want to test the module with

	$ make test

Example programs are included in the POD and in test.pl.
